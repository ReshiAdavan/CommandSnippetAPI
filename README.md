# CommandSnippetAPI

Have you ever found it difficult to keep track of commands, their use-cases and significance? I know I have. So, I created a CRUD API developer tool which helps me remember command snippets.

On paper, this API can be somewhat redundant due to the vast variety of resources online, however, it becomes more practical the more you use it. By having the ability to paraphrase commands to my preference and storing it in a database, its much easier to retrieve information. Thus, making your preferred commands more accessible and making software development easier. 

### Features

- Extremely easy-to-use functionality. Create, update, store, and delete code snippets.
- Utilizes dependency injection, automapping & Data-Transfer-Objects (DTOs).
- Command snippets are stored in a backend SQL Database managed in SSMS.
- Command snippets can be retreived extremely quickly and efficiently with the use of SQL.

### Skills
