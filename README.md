# CommandSnippetAPI

Especially when I first started full-stack development and learned different frameworks, tools, etc,. I found it quite difficult to keep track of commands, their use-cases and significance. Here's a perfect analogy. Imagine having to work at a grocery store as a cashier and scanning produce items for checkout. These items dont have barcodes so you have to manually input 4-5 digit codes for each item. I think you're starting to get the idea. In both scnearios, there is a lot to remember and having some sort of reference just in case we forget is quite useful.

You may think that this API can be somewhat redundant because there are millions of forums/docs out there for almost everything. However, the reason why I think its useful is because I can paraphrase and log commands to my preference and understanding. Plus, having a more concise and information-dense reference makes navigation processes more efficient.
